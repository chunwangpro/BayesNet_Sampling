## Implements

Or

Open a terminal at the folder and cd to a working conda environment, then run:

```bash
python python-filepath-OR-drag-python-file-into-the-terminal
```

Then press enter.

Example:

```bash
python ./main.py
```

Then press enter.

## Results

Generally, we have some print results shown in the terminal and an extra window appears with figure plottings. For multiple figures, you may need to close the current one in order to show the next.

Figures will also be saved in the folder after running experiments.
